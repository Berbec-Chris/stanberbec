<h3>Residencial building in Bonnevoie<br></h3>
<h5>2005-2008</h5>
<h4>Bonnevoie - Luxembourg</h4>
<p>The project comprises a complex of five residential units, developed from a 1960s terraced house and an adjacent plot owned by the same proprietor. Raising the roof of the existing building enabled the creation of additional living space across two new levels for the same family, as well as an extension accommodating three rental apartments. The roof dimensions permitted the introduction of natural daylight to both levels of the attic, one of which includes a mezzanine. This configuration maximises the use of the newly constructed volume. The approach enables a densification of the urban fabric without requiring modifications to public infrastructure, while significantly improving the cost-efficiency of land use.</p>
