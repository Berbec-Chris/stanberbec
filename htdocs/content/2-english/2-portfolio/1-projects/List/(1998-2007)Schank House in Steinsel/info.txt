<h3>Extension of the Schank house in Steinsel<br></h3>
<h5>1998-2007</h5>
<h4>Steinsel - Luxembourg</h4>
<p>The swimming pool project represents the third extension of a house originally built in the 1950s, whose architecture is relatively well integrated into the surrounding parkland in Steinsel. The structure enclosing the pool was designed to preserve the established balance between the natural landscape and the built environment, in response to the family's evolving needs.</p>
