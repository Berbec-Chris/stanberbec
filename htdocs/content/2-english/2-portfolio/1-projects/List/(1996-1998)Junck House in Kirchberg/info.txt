<h3>Junck House in Kirchberg<br></h3>
<h5>1996–1998</h5>
<h4>Kirchberg – Luxembourg</h4>
<p>The house, originally built in 1954, was passed down by the senior members of the Junck family to their children, who commissioned its transformation. The aim of the project was to adapt the building to the needs of its new residents and to give it a renewed identity. The existing volume was re-clad with sandstone façades, while larger window openings were introduced to maximise natural light within the interior. The architectural language and expression were redefined, altering the character of the home. Natural materials such as stone, wood, white exposed concrete, and steel establish the new architectural identity and contribute to a renewed spatial balance.</p>
