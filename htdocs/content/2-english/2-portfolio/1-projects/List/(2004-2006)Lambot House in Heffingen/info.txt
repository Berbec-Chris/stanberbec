<h3>Lambot House in Heffingen<br></h3>
<h5>2004-2006</h5>
<h4>Heffingen - Luxembourg</h4>
<p>The redevelopment project involved the conversion of agricultural buildings, including the adaptation of a barn and the addition of a new floor above the existing garage, which is part of the residential complex. A terrace was added on the garden side at attic level. The ground floor of the annex adjoining the barn on the garden side was converted into a winter garden, integrated as part of the existing house. A connection between the house and the winter garden was created on the first-floor level.</p>
