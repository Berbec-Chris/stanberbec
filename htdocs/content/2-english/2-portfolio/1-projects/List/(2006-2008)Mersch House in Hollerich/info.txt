<h3>Transformation of the Mersch House in Hollerich<br/></h3>
<h5>2006-2008</h5>
<h4>Hollerich - Luxembourg</h4>
<p>The renovation of the Mersch House involved a full interior reconfiguration and the transformation of the garden-facing façade, creating a renewed relationship between the house and its exterior spaces. Originally more secluded, the garden was reimagined as a central living and leisure area, now fully integrated into the daily life of the occupants.</p> <p>The attic was entirely converted into habitable space. The street-facing façade was restored, including the mansard roof, whose original profile was retained. On the garden side, two new dormer windows were introduced to provide generous natural light to the attic-level bedroom. The existing rear annex was restructured, with its façade clad in timber.</p> <p>The ground level of the garden adjacent to the house was lowered to allow for the construction of a terrace at basement level (-1), directly connected to the main living areas. A footbridge links the raised ground floor to the mid-level garden, enabling direct access. An infinity pool was installed along the length of the garden, visually connecting with the double-height living room.</p>
