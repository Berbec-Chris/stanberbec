<h3>Extension of a heritage building in Limpertsberg<br></h3>
<h6>Unbuilt</h6>

<h4>Limpertsberg - Luxembourg</h4>
<p>In Luxembourg, the high cost of land significantly increases the overall cost of construction. Buildable plots are scarce or inaccessible to most families. One potential solution to support residential development would be to regulate the conversion of attics and the expansion of existing buildings. This would allow for the densification of the existing urban fabric without fundamentally altering the historical, social, or architectural character of entire neighbourhoods.</p>
